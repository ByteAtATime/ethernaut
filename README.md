# Ethernaut

These are my solutions to the [Ethernaut](https://ethernaut.openzeppelin.com/) wargame.

Each level has its own directory with (eventually) a `README.md` file that gives a few hints and explains the solution.

## Roadmap

* Add solutions for the remaining levels
* Add a "Why it's important" section to each README
* Add a "Further reading" section to each README
* Add instructions on how to clone and run the levels locally
